Question: the input query you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do. If you just called the get_item_details tool, DO NOT CALL THE order_tool TOOL.
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action. If the order_tool tool has been chosen, the input should
be in valid JSON. Do not change the names of the keys. Follow the format:
[{{"item_name" : string, "quantity_ordered" : string, "order_note" : string}}].
If given, item_name should hold information about the size of the item.
order_note is to hold extra information about the specific order item, such as allergies or additions.
**IMPORTANT** Remember, item_name, quantity_ordered, and order_note must not be changed but must always be present.

... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input query. Do not say Final Answer until the order has
been placed and you know what part of the order succeeded and failed.
Question: {input}
